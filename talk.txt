projection - the scale that converts coordinates to pixels

path - the function that turns pixels to path strings

geojson - a data structure to encode geography 
- geojson.org
- GeoJSON Spec is RFC 7946

Types
  -- Features -- 
    Must have 'properties': JSON object | JSON null value
    Must have 'type': 'Feature' pair
    Must have 'geometry': Geometry object | JSON null value

 -- FeatureCollection -- 
    FeatureCollections contain a property named features with a value that is: [ {}, {}, {}, ... ]
    Must Not have properties named 'coordinates', 'geometries', 'geometry' or 'properties'

Geometry Types (there are seven)
- Must contain a property 'type' with a value that is one of the seven geometry types.
- Must contain a property 'coordinates' with a value that is an array
- Must Not have properties named 'geometry' or 'properties'

Zero Dimensions
  1) Point - [ longitude, latitude ]
  2) MultiPoint - [ Point, Point, ... ]

One Dimensions
  3) LineString - [ [long, lat], [long, lat], [long, lat], ... ] (must contain 2 or more items in the array)
  4) MultiLineString - [ LineString, LineString, ... ]

Two Dimensions
  5) Polygon - [ [ Point, Point, Point, Point, ... ], [ Point, Point, Point, Point, ... ], ... ]
    - Also known as linear ring
    - Must have 4 or more positions 
    - The first and last elements must be identical
    - If the polygon has multiple linear rings, the first must be the exterior ring and the rest are interior rings
  6) MultiPolygon - [ Polygon, Polygon, ...]

Heterogeneous
  7) GeometryCollection [ {Geometry Object}, {Geometry Object}, ... ]
   - Must have a property named 'geometries' with a value that is an array
   - Each value in the array must be a geometry type and can be mixed


-- Additional info 
  a. coordinate with 6 decimal places bring accuracy to about 10 centimeters
  b. objects may have foreign property/values as long as they are JSON complient
  c. Geography that crosses the antimeridian line should be split into two geometry types
